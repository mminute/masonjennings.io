                                    If you want people to build on your code, it needs three things:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>An obvious way to extend it</li>
                                        <li>An easy way to extend it</li>
                                        <li>A fast way to extend it</li>

                                <p>                    
                                    'Cyclomatic complexity’ … means ‘number of paths through code’<br/>
                                    When code is as simple as the problem you’re trying to solve, then you’ve succeeded. … Code can never be simpler thatn the problem it is trying to solve: that’s when you’ve done enough.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Bob Martin developed three rules for unit tests…
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>You are not allowed to write any code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.</li>
                                        <li>You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.</li>
                                        <li>You are not allowed to write any more code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </p>
            
            
                                <strong>Ch 12: Each Line Changed is a Chance for a Bug</strong>
                                <p>
                                    If you want to be sure, you will need to test in multiple layers: code review, black-box testing, fuzz testing, white-box testing, unit-tests, functional tests, manual tests, formal verification, design verification, etc.  The more layers of testing, the fewer bugs.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Fuzz testing: providing invalid/unexpected/random inputs to a program</li>
                                            <li>White box testing: intern structure of a program is known to the tester</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    A simpler way to introduce unit tests to an old project is to only write them for code you need to change anyway…

                                <p>
                                    “The term Literate Programming means writing your program for a human to read”<br/>
                                    “... for a deep taste of literate programming, download cweb and play.”

                                <strong>Ch 19: Structural vs Real Code</strong>
                                <p>
                                    Real code is code that actually does things: open a file, draw on the screen… Structural code connects things together. … minimize structural code as much as possible.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    When an argument goes on for a long time, it is usually because of a lack of data, or because neither side is right.<br/>
                                    If you haven’t timed your code before the change and after the change, you don’t know whether you’ve improved things or slowed them down.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    A way to help examine your own ideas (and other people’s) is to recognize when you are proposing a hypothesis… If someone presents an idea without any evidence to back it up, it’s a hypothesis.

                                <p>
                                    Sometimes programmers create bugs by trying to fit every piece of code into a design pattern.  Instead of increasing flexibility, they decrease flexibility because the problem isn’t well defined, and isn’t a good match for the chosen design pattern.                        
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Writing code before it needs to be written is poor management.<br/>
                                    Clean the things that have serious potential to cause problems, like poor interfaces, or doce that you are working on right now

                                <p>
                                    Fixing mistakes, instead of starting over from scratch, is the way to learn.<br/>
                                    Any time we change a software standard, it’s an act of violence. It’s disruptive. It will cause stuff to fail.  It will cause cost and harm people
